            I am so grateful to have met you and to have had the chance to know you this long.
            You’ve been such an incredible addition to my life. With you, I feel safe, loved, and so, so, sooooo happy.
            As you’ve said before, a relationship isn’t always easy, but when I look back at all the moments we’ve shared,
            I’m grateful for every single one.
          </p>
          <p>
            From laughing, singing, dancing, cooking, taking trips, hugging, and kissing,
            to talking through difficult parts of our lives and being vulnerable with each other,
            I treasure it all, because each moment brings us that much closer.
            I love you so much, and I am so excited for our future together.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wish you the best of luck with clinicals, and I know you’re going to be an amazing PA.
            I can’t wait for us to share stories about our days at work, even the tough ones,
            knowing that we’ll always be there for each other.
            I can honestly say I am the happiest I’ve been in a long time.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m so glad I met you, and here’s to many, many more months together bb!
            I love you with all my heart! ❤️
